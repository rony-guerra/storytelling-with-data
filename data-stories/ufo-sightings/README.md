# Project Information

This project provides a detailed analysis of UFO sightings data, aiming to uncover patterns and trends in reported sightings across different dimensions.

# Overview

The project delves into the following questions: What are the prevailing patterns in UFO sightings over time and space? Are there specific temporal or geographical factors influencing sightings? Additionally, how do cultural influences and media portrayals affect the perception and reporting of UFO encounters?

Data for this analysis was sourced from the National UFO Reporting Center, encompassing reports spanning from the early 20th century to recent years. Through data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization techniques, the project aims to shed light on the nature of UFO sightings and the factors influencing their occurrence.

Key findings include:

1) A gradual increase in reported sightings over the decades, with notable spikes corresponding to significant cultural events or shifts in reporting mechanisms.
2) Seasonal variations in sighting frequencies, with higher occurrences during certain months, potentially influenced by weather conditions and outdoor activities.
3) The influence of cultural events, such as Independence Day in the United States, on reported sightings, suggesting a correlation between public events and increased UFO activity.

Future directions for this project involve continued monitoring of UFO sighting data to identify emerging trends and conducting further analyses to explore the socio-cultural factors shaping perceptions and reporting of UFO encounters.

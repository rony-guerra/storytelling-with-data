#Project Information

This project presents a comprehensive data story on the impact of recent aim assist changes in the video game "The Finals."

#Overview

Central to this project were the questions: How have the recent aim assist changes influenced players' perceptions of fairness and competitiveness in "The Finals"? Do these changes impact players' strategies and overall engagement with the game?


Data was gathered from a survey distributed through the official "The Finals" Discord and Reddit communities, which collected players' feedback on their experiences before and after the aim assist changes. 
This data included their satisfaction with specific aim assist adjustments, the perceived fairness of gameplay, and their intention to continue playing and recommending the game.

Key findings were that: 1) a significant portion of the player base adapted to the aim assist changes without altering their gameplay strategies; 
2) while some players welcomed the changes for bringing balance and enhancing competitiveness, others felt the adjustments disadvantaged them, particularly console players; 
3) despite the aim assist changes, a substantial number of players did not intend to change their engagement with the game.

Future directions for this work include ongoing monitoring of player feedback as further adjustments are made, and a deeper dive into the specific gameplay elements most affected by aim assist changes. 
A broader study could also explore the long-term effects of these changes on the game's competitive landscape and player retention.

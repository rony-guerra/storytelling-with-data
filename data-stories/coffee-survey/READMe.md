# Project Information

Analyzed real survey results to craft a data-driven strategy for opening a new coffee shop.
# Overview

This project revolves around the Maven Coffee Challenge, where I serve as an Analytics Consultant. Tasked by a consortium of investors eager to enter the U.S. coffee market, my mission is to harness the rich insights from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test". The investors possess the entrepreneurial spirit but require analytical prowess to extract actionable insights — a gap my expertise fills.

# Analytical Deep-Dive

With a focus on the investors' interests and open to unearthing new findings, I dove into data to craft a strategic plan for their debut coffee shop. This included:

Target Audience: Identifying the ideal customer profile — demographics, preferences, and behaviors that define our core market.
Product Offering: Determining the coffee beans and beverage lineup that will resonate with our target audience and set us apart in a competitive market.
Pricing Strategy: Developing a pricing model that reflects the perceived value and aligns with customer spending habits.
# Strategic Report

My explanatory report will encompass an analytical strategy that's grounded in data and tailored to guide the investors through the nuances of market entry. It will highlight customer targeting tactics, a curated product offering, and a savvy pricing strategy, all designed to position the new coffee shop as a market leader attuned to consumer desires and market dynamics.
